# faunadb-nodejs-examples


Familiarizing myself with FaunaDB and hoping to lessen the learning curve for others!

# Getting started
  - Create a databse using fauna shell or the dashboard
  - Create a .env file with `FDB_FQL_ADMIN_KEY=<your admin key>` (and GQL keys, if applicable)
  - `yarn` or `npm install`
  - Check out some scripts! I recommend looking at fql/auth and fauna-bootstrap first.
  - To run any script, `node <path/to/script>`

Tasks:
- [x] Make a script to bootstrap a database
- [ ] Convert script into a more flexible CLI utility / make better automated tasks
- [x] Model a basic user authentication flow
- [ ] **YOUR IDEA HERE :o)**
